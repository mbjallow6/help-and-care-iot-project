## How to contribute 
- Clone the repo to your local machine
- Create a new branch
- Write your code and commit
** Before starting work, always pull the latest changes from the master branch using `git pull origin main`.
** Switch to your feature branch before making changes `git checkout your-branch-name`.
** Once changes are made, you can stage them using `git add .`, commit them using `git commit -m "commit message"`, and push them using `git push origin your-branch-name`.

## Making a pull request
- Once you've pushed your branch to GitHub, you can create a pull request (PR) in GitHub.
- Click on 'Pull requests' tab, then 'New pull request'.
- Select your feature branch from the dropdown and create the PR. 
- The team can review the changes, request additional updates, comment, and finally merge the changes into the main branch.

## Syncing Your Fork
- Over time, the main branch will change as other teammates merge their changes. To keep your local copy up to date, you should periodically sync your fork. This can be done by using `git pull origin main` command.

## Conflict Resolution
- If there are conflicts between your branch and the main branch when trying to merge, GitHub will tell you in the PR.
- If there are merge conflicts, you'll have to resolve them manually. Open the files with conflicts and you'll see conflict markers where the conflicts are. Resolve each conflict, then stage, commit, and push the changes.

## Deploy the code
- Before deploying code, always test it thoroughly in your local environment.
- Always pull the latest code from the main branch before deploying.
